Animations for section content (fade-in-up) and background elements (blob-float).

Services Page:

Individual cards for each service (SEO & Content, Social Media, Paid Ads, Web Design, Email Marketing, Analytics).

Provides more in-depth descriptions for each service.

"Back to Home" button for easy navigation.

Responsive Design: Utilizes Tailwind CSS to ensure optimal viewing and functionality across various devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).

Attractive UI: Features a soft purple and blue color scheme, elegant gradients, rounded elements, and subtle hover effects designed to be appealing.

3. Setup Instructions
To run this website locally, simply save the provided HTML code into an .html file (e.g., index.html) and open it using any modern web browser.

Steps:

Create a new file, for example, index.html.

Copy and paste the entire HTML code into this file.

Save the file.

Open index.html by double-clicking it in your file explorer, or by dragging it into your web browser.

The website is self-contained within this single HTML file, utilizing CDN links for Tailwind CSS and Google Fonts. No additional installations or complex setup procedures are required.

4. Page Flow
The website's navigation is structured as follows:

Home Page (Landing Page)

Click "Explore Our Services" or the "Services" link in the header → Services Page

Click "Get a Free Consultation" or the "Contact" link in the header → Contact Us Page

From Services Page or Contact Us Page:

Click "Back to Home" (or "Home" in the header) → Returns to the Landing Page.

5. Technologies Used
HTML5: Provides the foundational structure of the web pages.

CSS (Tailwind CSS CDN): Used for a utility-first approach to styling, enabling rapid development of responsive and visually attractive layouts.

JavaScript: Implements the interactive elements and handles the page navigation logic (showing and hiding different sections of the single-page application).

Google Fonts (Poppins, Lato): Utilized for modern and readable typography, enhancing the overall aesthetic.

6. Customization
Content:

All text content (headlines, descriptions, service details) can be easily updated to reflect your agency's specific messaging and expertise.

Replace the placeholder image for Inchara K.M. with an actual photo for a more personalized touch.

Update the contact email and phone number in the JavaScript function showContactPage() and directly in the HTML of the contact page.

Styling:

Adjust the color palette and gradients by modifying the custom CSS variables and Tailwind classes.

Experiment with font-family properties in the <style> block to find different typographic combinations.

The hero-background-blob animations can be tweaked for different movement patterns and speeds.

Functionality:

This is a single-page application where content is hidden/shown using JavaScript. For a more complex site, you might consider a client-side routing library.

The "Get a Free Consultation" button currently links to a mailto: address and a tel: number. For a real agency, you would integrate a contact form connected to a backend.

You can easily add more service cards to the Services Page by following the existing HTML structure.
